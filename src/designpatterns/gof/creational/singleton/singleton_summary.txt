1. EagerInitialization - bad for memory
2. LazyInitialization -- better for memory but watch out for thread safety. Also prone to reflection attacks. For serialization to work
implement readResolve() method;
3. BillPugh -- ok for memory and thread-safe, does not require synchronization. Prone to reflection attacks.
5. EnumSingleton -- good for reflection attacks, thread-safe, but does not allow lazy initialization as instance is created
at the time enum is loaded.
